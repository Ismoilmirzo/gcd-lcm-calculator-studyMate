# StudyMate App

StudyMate is a Python application built with PyQt5 that helps students learn and solve GCD and LCM in math. The app calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers.

## Features

- Calculate GCD and LCM: Enter integers in the table, and the app will calculate the GCD and LCM for you.
- Add and Remove Rows: Easily add or remove rows in the table to accommodate more or fewer numbers.
- Input Validation: Only numerical inputs are allowed, and zero values are not allowed.
- Clear and Execute: Clear the table or calculate the GCD and LCM with a click of a button.

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
python main.py

Usage
Enter numerical values in the table cells.
Use the "+" button to add more rows for additional numbers.
Use the "-" button to remove rows.
Click the "Clear" button to clear the table.
Click the "Execute" button to calculate the GCD and LCM.
The GCD and LCM results will be displayed at the bottom.
